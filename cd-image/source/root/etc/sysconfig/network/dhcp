## Description:	DHCP configuration tweaking
#
# Note: 
# To configure one or more interfaces for DHCP configuration, you have to
# change the BOOTPROTO variable in /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-<interface>
# to 'dhcp' (and possibly set STARTMODE='onboot'). 
#
# Most of these options are used only by dhcpcd, not by the ISC dhclient
# (which uses a config file).
#
# Most of the options can be overridden by setting them in the ifcfg-* files,
# too.
#
# Note: The ISC dhclient started by the NetworkManager is not using any
# of these options -- NetworkManager is not using any sysconfig settings.

## Type: list("",yes,no,first)
## Default: ""
#
# Multiple DHCP clients:
#
# With two or more DHCP clients running, they would concurrently try to replace
# the default route or set the hostname. There are several ways of dealing with
# this conflict (and it is a conflict, because you can have only one default
# route even though routes are stackable and the dhcp clients would change it
# while every lease renew):
#
#  1) Allow both clients to do that stuff. This would work in many cases if
#     only one of the interfaces is used at a time. However, it would lead to
#     undefined behaviour such as changing default route e.g. on dhcp renew.
#
#  2) When both interfaces are connected to the same network, you may configure
#     a bonding interface in active-backup mode (or another, e.g. 802.3ad, when
#     supported and configured by the switch) and configure dhcp on the bonding
#     instead.
#
#  3) When only one of the interfaces is used at time, you may set STARTMODE to
#     ifplugd and specify the priority of the interfaces in IFPLUGD_PRIORITY.
#     This is a common scenario for notebooks to use the wired interface when
#     connected, wireless otherwise.
#
#  4) allow only one of the DHCP clients to do that stuff.
#     This implies that there would be a "primary" interface and a "secondary".
#     This is the assumption the default configuration is based on. But since
#     the system often can't guess which interface is "more important", we
#     simply choose one depending on related configuration or take the first
#     interface that is started with DHCP to be primary ("authoritative").
#     This can be configured by setting DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE=yes in one of
#     the /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-* files and DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE=no
#     in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp (or in all other ifcfg files using DHCP).
#
# When DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE is not explicitly configured to yes/no, the
# "primary" interface is choosed as follows:
#
# - On systems with iSCSI Boot Firmare Table, the iBFT primary interface
#   is used as the primary DHCP interface by default.
# - On systems booting via PXE, the interface specified by the BOOTIF kernel
#   parameter is used as primary DHCP interface. Set the global "ipappend 2"
#   parameter in pxelinux.cfg/* files, so the BOOTIF kernel parameter is set.
# - Otherwise, the DHCP client that is started first will be "primary" and
#   allowed the set the default route and hostname ("first up wins" mode,
#   the only one before openSUSE 11.4). To force this "first up wins" mode,
#   set DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE="first" in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp.
#
# All other running dhcp clients will only configure the interface with an
# address and network routes, but not change the "global" default route or
# hostname.
# See also DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE and DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME variables,
# that allow to modify the DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE parameter behaviour once
# again.
#
# Thus, to specifically allow an interface's DHCP client to change "global"
# configuration, set the following variable to "yes". Or you can make an
# interface's DHCP client never change these settings if you set it to "no".
# If you leave it empty then ifup-dhcp will decide.

DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE=""

## Type:	yesno
## Default:	no
#
# Should the DHCP client set the hostname? (yes|no)
# 
# When it is likely that this would occur during a running X session, 
# your DISPLAY variable could be screwed up and you won't be able to open
# new windows anymore, then this should be "no". 
#
# If it happens during booting it won't be a problem and you can 
# safely say "yes" here. For a roaming notebook with X kept running, "no"
# makes more sense.

## Type:	yesno
## Default:	yes
#
# Should the DHCP client set a default route (default Gateway) (yes|no)
#
# When multiple copies of dhcpcd run, it would make sense that only one
# of them does it. 
#
DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE="yes"

## Type:	integer

#
# Lease time to request ( -l option)

# Specifies (in seconds) the lease that is suggested to the server.

DHCLIENT_LEASE_TIME=""

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     yes
#
# dhcpcd -E/--lastlease option
#
# This setting controls whether dhcpcd should try to use DHCP settings
# provided in its last lease when the dhcp-server is not reachable and

# Set this variable to "no" to disable the fallback to the last lease.

DHCLIENT_USE_LAST_LEASE="yes"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	"0"
#
# dhcpcd -t/--timeout option
#
# You can set the timeout - dhcpcd will terminate after this time when
# does not get a reply from the dhcp server. The dhcpcd default timeout
# is 20 seconds, we set it to 0 to and wait forever to get a lease.
#
# Note: In the past, this setting was set to a much higher value (999999)
# by default, because the dhcpcd < 3.2.3 didn't provided a infinite one.

DHCLIENT_TIMEOUT="0"

## Type:	string
## Default:	AUTO
#
# specify a hostname to send ( -h option)
#
# specifies a string used for the hostname option field when dhcpcd sends DHCP
# messages. Some DHCP servers will update nameserver entries (dynamic DNS).
# Also, some DHCP servers, notably those used by @Home Networks, require the
# hostname option field containing a specific string in the DHCP messages from
# clients.
#
# By default the current hostname is sent ("AUTO"), if one is defined in 
# /etc/HOSTNAME. 
# Use this variable to override this with another hostname, or leave empty
# to not send a hostname.

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
#
# specify a client ID ( -I option)
#
# Specifies a client identifier string. By default the hardware address of the
# network interface is sent as client identifier string, if none is specified
# here.
#
# Note that dhcpcd will prepend a zero to what it sends to the server. In the
# server configuration, you need to write the following to match on it:
#  option dhcp-client-identifier "\0foo";

#
# Before ifup-dhcp is going to start dhcp clients, it will set up the link
# when needed. Then it has to wait until the link is ready. This setting
# allows to specify the time how long to wait. Default is half of the time
# in the DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT variable.
#
DHCLIENT_WAIT_LINK=""

## Type:	integer
## Default:	0
#
# Some interfaces need time to initialize and/or do not report correct status.
# Add the latency time in seconds so these can be handled properly. Should
# probably set per interface rather than here.
# This setting causes a sleep time before dhcp clients are started regardless
# of the link status (wait time in DHCLIENT_WAIT_LINK).
#
DHCLIENT_SLEEP="0"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	15
#
# When the DHCP client is started at boot time, the boot process will stop
# until the interface is successfully configured, but at most for
# DHCLIENT_WAIT_AT_BOOT seconds. Do not set this variable higher than the
# WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES variable -- it is adjusted to WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES/2
# as default.

# Note: RFC 2131 specifies, that the dhcp client should wait a random time
# between one and ten seconds to desynchronize the use of DHCP at startup.
